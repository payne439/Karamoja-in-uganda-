# Karamoja Food Security Monitoring Dashboard

##  Project Overview
This project presents an **interactive Tableau dashboard** that monitors food security in **Karamoja, Uganda**. It combines **population data** and **agricultural yield data** to provide insights into food availability and demand across districts and sub-counties.  

---

##  Objectives
- Import and clean external datasets in Tableau.  
- Join **Population** and **Yield** data on District and Sub-county.  
- Build an **interactive dashboard** with maps, charts, and filters.  
- Highlight trends and challenges affecting food security in Karamoja.  

---

##  Data Sources
- **Population Dataset** – Sub-county and district-level population figures.  
- **Yield Dataset** – Agricultural production statistics by crop type.  

---

## 🛠️ Methodology
1. Imported `.csv` datasets into Tableau.  
2. Cleaned and standardized fields (districts and sub-counties).  
3. Performed joins between **Population** and **Yield** datasets.  
4. Designed dashboard visuals: maps, bar charts, and trend lines.
